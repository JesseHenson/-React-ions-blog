How it works: 

* In client make a query 
* Each field in query maps to resolver 
* Each resolver makes api and caches it optimally

# 1. Less Data 
* The server makes an api call
* Sends out only the data you need
* Sends out the data in the way you want it. 

# 2. High performance 
* Less data means faster speeds 
* Caching of server data allows for less calls 

# 3. Be Picky
* Pick up only the data you need 
* An api could contain large objects - you only need parts of it 

# 4. Some Serious Infrustructure (Environment)
* Apollo
* Gatsby (with built in)
* Relay
* More...
